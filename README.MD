## CodexME

Now CodexMe will use Go for the backend and React for the frontend. You may ask yourself why:

After a few months without checking the original CodexMe built with the Reflex platform, I realized the website was no longer running. This was because so many changes had been made to the framework that it would take a significant amount of time to make it work again.
This made me realize that although I want to check the site regularly, I don't want to focus on keeping it running. Instead, I want to enjoy exploring new challenges that users upload and have fun with those. Switching to a more stable stack will allow me to spend less time fixing what's broken and more time on other activities.

Welcome to CodexMe! An online website made to participate in the "HolaMundo Day" by MoureDEV( Brais Moure). on which you can run and compile small scripst, made for learning and challenge yourself and others. You can create your own lessons and coding problems (still work in progress). This website was made on Reflex, using postgresql with supabase. Feel free to reach me out. Se habla espa√±ol!!

# Next Feautures:

Code challenges: Each verified user will be able to update its own code challenge, also every verified user will be able to do the challenge and submit the results
Learning: Every user even without verification would be able to navigate to the learning site, the idea its that users can also upload their own lessons.
